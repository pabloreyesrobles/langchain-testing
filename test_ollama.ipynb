      "3. Medication: In some cases, medication may be prescribed to manage symptoms of depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues that contribute to hikikomori.\n",
      "4. Support groups: Joining a support group can provide individuals with hikikomori an opportunity to connect with others who share their experiences and receive emotional support.\n",
